# Overview of Project

## Research Question/Topic
**How do universities compare with the type and amount of research publications?**
  - Academic fields (humanities vs. STEM)
  - Public vs. Private
  - R1 vs. R2
  - Prediction on new policies may affect universities
  - How it may affect admission, funding, research publications etc.
  
## Key Questions:
  - How does the number and type of research publications differ between humanities and STEM fields?
  - What is the relationship between a universityâ€™s classification (public/private, R1/R2) and its research output?
  - How might changes in policies regarding funding, research priorities, or admissions affect these relationships?

## Data and Research Sources
**Sources**
*1. Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education*
  - Classification of R1 vs. R2 Schools
*2. Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS)* 
  - Includes data on U.S. universities
  
**Data Collection**
  - Number and type of publications (e.g., STEM vs. humanities).
  - Institutional classification (Public vs. Private, R1 vs. R2).
  - Funding and admission data.
  - Information on new or proposed policies affecting research funding, publication incentives, or admissions.
